```

### UIView

Animating Views with Blocks

```objective-c
+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations;
+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
```

Configuring the Bounds and Frame Rectangles

```objective-c
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) CGFloat x;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) CGFloat y;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) CGFloat width;
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) CGFloat height;
```

Managing the View Hierarchy

```objective-c
- (void)removeAllSubviews;
```

### UIImage

Image Loading Routines

```objective-c
+ (UIImage *)maskedImageNamed:(NSString *)name color:(UIColor *)color;
+ (UIImage *)squareImageWithImage:(UIImage *)image size:(NSInteger)size;
+ (UIImage *)squareImageWithImage:(UIImage *)image size:(int)size scale:(CGFloat)scale;
```

### UIImageView

Initializing a UIImageView Object

```objective-c
+ (id)imageViewWithImage:(UIImage *)image position:(CGPoint)position;
+ (id)imageViewWithImage:(UIImage *)image x:(CGFloat)x y:(CGFloat)y;
+ (id)imageViewWithImageNamed:(NSString *)imageName position:(CGPoint)position;
+ (id)imageViewWithImageNamed:(NSString *)imageName x:(CGFloat)x y:(CGFloat)y;
```

### UIColor

Creating a UIColor Object from Component Values

```objective-c
+ (UIColor *)colorWithRGBHex:(UInt32)hex;
+ (UIColor *)colorWithRGBHex:(UInt32)hex alpha:(CGFloat)alpha;
```

### UIControl

Preparing and Sending Action Messages

```objective-c
- (void)setBlock:(void (^)(void))block forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)event;
```
